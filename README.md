# Abstract
In today’s digital era, event management platforms play a crucial role in connecting people with events that match their interests. The "EventFinder" project is designed as a full-stack web application that enables users to discover and participate in a wide range of events worldwide, including concerts, sports meets, BTS Army fan gatherings, political rallies, and more. It serves both event organizers and participants by offering a seamless experience for event discovery, booking, and real-time navigation.

The platform provides an intuitive interface where users can search for events based on location, interests, and categories (paid or free). Organizers can create, update, and manage events while ensuring the availability of essential details such as venue, time, and description. For free events, users can view details and navigate to the location, whereas paid events require a booking and payment process integrated into the platform. A verification system ensures the credibility of event organizers by requiring authorization proof for paid events.

To enhance user convenience, the platform integrates with Google Maps API for real-time navigation, allowing attendees to find the best route to the event venue. Additionally, a dynamic event display system updates event statuses visually—concluded events fade out and disappear to maintain an uncluttered interface. Users also receive notifications and countdown timers for upcoming events, improving engagement and event participation.

The EventFinder platform is built using modern technologies, including React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. These technologies ensure scalability, efficiency, and a user-friendly experience. With its automated features, secure payment integration, and interactive design, this project aims to revolutionize event discovery and participation.
